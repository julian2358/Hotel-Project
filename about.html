            <p id="p1">"This Westin offers a super swank ambiance, with plush guestrooms and elegant public spaces. The lobby is particularly pretty, with high ceilings and unique accents that include a garden wall and funky light fixtures made with what look like tree branches. The color scheme is a mix of yellow, aquamarine, and tangerine offset by light-colored wood floors and a smattering of earth-tone furnishings. Several small reception desks in lieu of one massive check-in counter make for a more personalized feel. And clusters of couches and chairs scattered around the lobby, as well as cushioned lounges and armchairs dotting the manicured grounds, add to the intimate vibe."      -Jessica Warren</p>

                    <p id ="p2">"Tucked away from the area's nearby main streets, the hotel is located on a road filled with private resorts and sits right on the beach. The resort fee includes a shuttle to the nearby Port Royal Golf Club, which is less than a 10-minute drive or 15-minute walk away, and the Port Royal Plaza Shopping Center, which is about a 5-minute drive away. The resort is around a 10-minute drive from the local Hilton Head Island Airport."  -Elizabeth Jennings</p>
